# GauthQR

This is a tool to read an image containing QR code and output a line for
the `gauth.csv` used by the gauth tool (https://github.com/pcarrier/gauth/).

This can be used to export OTP codes from google authenticator without root
on your android device.

## TODO

Output rich URLs for formats which don't match the gauth short line
constraints.
